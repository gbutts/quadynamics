## Aims of this Guide

The intention of this resource is to develop and explain rotary wing aerodynamics principles as they pertain to lightweight quadcopters.

Quadcopters (and their six rotor cousins) share many fundamental aerodynamic principles with other rotary winged aircraft, but in certain areas, they are entirely different and are more similar to the propulsion units of turboprop aircraft.

This site will introduce new quadcopter operators to the main principles that their aircraft use to hover, climb and descend while carrying the camera that provides the wonderful video that they are seeking.

## About the Author

My name is Geoff Buttsworth. I am a recent arrival to the world of quadcopters. A few years ago I owned a first generation Parrot, happily driving it around with my iPad. Recently I purchased a Yuneec Q500 and despite one small mishap, have been happily flying it around my local area in Queensland, Australia for the past year or so.

I do, however, have a solid background in military aviation, most recently flying and instructing on Black Hawk helicopters with our Army. I have a good understanding of both fixed wing and rotary wing aerodynamics.

I have visited a few forums and noticed that some people, understandably, are having a little trouble understanding some of the more complex flying conditions they are encountering. Some are misunderstanding that it is not possible to engineer out some of the fundamental aerodynamic principles that quadcopters need to operate and cannot avoid.

I looked around and didn't find much info to guide either the new starters to the quadcopter world or for those with a bit of an understanding of full sized aircraft. So I thought that I would pull this guide together and learn about the similarities and differences while I went along.
